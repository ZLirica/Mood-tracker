# Mood-tracker

This is my fisrt "big" project with python, a supposed desktop app to help you check your mood thoughout the year. There is a library to store the daily mood input, a desktop pop-up feature to remind you to fill it and the function to choose your mood once in the app. 

Since i'm a beginner please tell me if anything can be added or changed. Dear reader, I really would appreciate it <3. 

To my bed and back,

Zlirica.
